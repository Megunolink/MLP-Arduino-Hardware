To include this library file in an Arduino Program project, you'll need to use the Visual Studio Property Manager. 
You can find the Property Manager in the View -> Other Windows menu. 

To include this library in your Arduino program:
1. Select the Arduino program's project in the Property Manager
2. Click the "Add existing property sheet" on the Property Manager toolbar. 
3. Browse to the library project and select the file named <library-project>.props

Building the Arduino Program will also build the referenced libraries. The libraries will pick up the
hardware settings (CPU, clock frequency etc) from the Arduino Program. This means if you have one 
program targeting a Mega and another targeting the Uno, both can use the same Arduino Library project
for common code.
